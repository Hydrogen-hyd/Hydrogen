## Problem Statement

Blockchain technology has brought transformative advancements in digital transactions and decentralized applications. However, many existing blockchain systems face persistent challenges, such as:

- **High Transaction Costs**: The expense of using blockchain often limits accessibility for smaller users and developers.
- **Slow Processing Speeds**: Delays in transaction finality hinder the scalability of many platforms.
- **Energy Consumption**: The environmental impact of energy-intensive consensus mechanisms, like Proof-of-Work (PoW), raises sustainability concerns.
- **Complexity**: Technical and user complexity make blockchain less approachable for widespread adoption.

These challenges limit the potential of blockchain technology. Hydrogen addresses these shortcomings with a platform that emphasizes efficiency, accessibility, and sustainability.
