## Hydrogen Blockchain Security Policy

Welcome to the Hydrogen Blockchain project! This document outlines the security measures, best practices, and reporting mechanisms to ensure the integrity and safety of the Hydrogen blockchain system.

---

## Supported Security Features

### 1. Consensus Mechanism
Hydrogen uses the **Proof of Authority (POA)** consensus mechanism, which ensures:
- **Efficient Validation:** Transactions are validated by trusted, pre-approved validators.
- **Reduced Risk of 51% Attacks:** Only authorized validators can participate in block creation, minimizing risks associated with bad actors.
- **High Throughput and Scalability:** The POA model is optimized for performance and minimizes delays.

### 2. Smart Contract Execution
Smart contracts are securely executed using the blockchain's deterministic environment. While flexibility is provided for contract creation, users are advised to test their contracts thoroughly in a sandboxed environment to avoid security loopholes.

### 3. Transaction Integrity
- Every transaction is cryptographically signed by the sender to prevent tampering.
- Blocks include the **hash of the current block** and the **hash of the previous block** for immutability and chain integrity.

### 4. Wallet Management
Hydrogen wallets are protected by cryptographic hashing, ensuring the security of user addresses and balances.

## Best Practices for Users

### For Smart Contracts
- **Audit Smart Contracts:** Always audit your smart contract code to prevent vulnerabilities like reentrancy attacks or overflow issues.
- **Keep Code Simple:** Avoid complex contract logic that may lead to unexpected outcomes.
- **Sandbox Testing:** Test smart contracts extensively before deploying them to the main blockchain.

### For Wallets
- **Protect Private Keys:** Always store private keys in a secure environment and never share them with others.
- **Monitor Balances:** Regularly check wallet balances and transaction history for any unauthorized changes.

### General Blockchain Use
- **Verify Validators:** Ensure that the validators in the POA setup are trusted and adhere to the rules of the network.
- **Monitor Updates:** Keep your software up-to-date to benefit from the latest security patches.

## Reporting Security Issues

If you discover any vulnerabilities or potential security issues in Hydrogen, please report them immediately. We take security reports seriously and will address them promptly.

### How to Report
1. Go to the Hydrogen [issues](https://github.com/Hydrogen-hyd/Hydrogen/issues) page.
2. Create and open up a new issue on that same page.
3. Include a detailed description of the issue, steps to reproduce it, and any relevant logs or screenshots.
4. Our team will acknowledge your report within **48 hours** and work with you to resolve the issue.

## Known Security Risks

While the Hydrogen blockchain is designed to be secure, the following risks are inherent in blockchain systems:

1. **Private Key Management:** Users are responsible for safeguarding their private keys. The project cannot recover lost or stolen keys.
2. **Smart Contract Vulnerabilities:** Poorly written contracts can lead to loss of funds or unexpected behavior. Audit and test your contracts carefully.
3. **Sybil Attacks in Validator Selection:** Although POA minimizes this risk by pre-approving validators, the initial validator setup must ensure trustworthiness.

## Future Enhancements

We are actively working to improve the security of Hydrogen. Planned enhancements include:
- Multi-signature wallet support for additional transaction security.
- Advanced monitoring tools for validator activity.
- Integration of automatic smart contract auditing tools.
